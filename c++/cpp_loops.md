C++ LOOPS DEMONSTRATION

This program demonstrates various loop structures in C++:

1. for loop - when number of iterations is known
2. while loop - when condition needs to be checked first
3. do-while loop - when loop must execute at least once
4. Nested loops - loops within loops
5. break and continue statements for loop control
6. Range-based for loop (C++11 feature) for iterating through containers

The program shows basic usage of each loop type with simple examples.

To compile and run:
g++ cpp_loops.cpp -o cpp_loops -std=c++11
./cpp_loops
