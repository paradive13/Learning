C++ OPERATORS DEMONSTRATION

This program demonstrates all major types of operators in C++:

1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, % (modulus)
2. Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
3. Logical Operators: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
4. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
5. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
6. Ternary Operator: ? :

The program shows basic usage of each operator with example values and prints the results using C++ cout.

To compile and run:
g++ cpp_operators.cpp -o cpp_operators
./cpp_operators
