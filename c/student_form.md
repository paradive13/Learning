STUDENT INFORMATION FORM

This program demonstrates:
1. Structures - to store student information
2. Pointers - to access structure members
3. String handling - for name input and manipulation
4. User input - getting data from the user

The program:
- Creates a Student structure with name, roll number, marks, and grade
- Takes input from user for each field
- Demonstrates pointer access to structure members
- Shows basic string operations (copying, length)

To compile and run:
gcc student_form.c -o student_form
./student_form

Note: The program handles basic user input but could be enhanced with more validation.
