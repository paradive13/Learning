This script demonstrates various loop structures in Python:

1. for loop - with range() and iterables
2. while loop - with condition
3. Nested loops - loops within loops
4. Loop control - break and continue
5. Iterating through different data structures:
   - Lists
   - Dictionaries
   - Strings
6. enumerate() - for getting index and value

The script shows basic usage of each loop type with simple examples.
